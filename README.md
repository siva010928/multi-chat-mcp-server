## 🎯 What is Google Chat MCP Server?

**Google Chat MCP Server** is an open-source, production-ready **Model Control Protocol (MCP) server** designed for **Google Chat integration with AI assistants**. Built with an extensible **multi-provider architecture**, this project provides a robust foundation for integrating AI assistants with team chat platforms.

### 🏢 Built for Organizational Security & Privacy

**Important Security Note:** This tool is **designed for local, organizational use only**. We strongly recommend using this with **organization-provided on-premises LLM instances or your local installed LLM Agent Model** rather than cloud-based LLM model's to maintain complete control over your team's chat data and communications.

**Why Local/On-Premises Deployment:**
- **Data Privacy**: Keep sensitive team conversations within your organization
- **Security Compliance**: Meet enterprise security and compliance requirements
- **Full Control**: Maintain complete oversight of data flow and access
- **Custom Policies**: Implement organization-specific security measures

While anyone can adapt this tool for their particular use cases, it's designed with enterprise security as a priority.

### Current Implementation Status

- ✅ **Google Chat Provider** - **Production Ready** with comprehensive API coverage
- 🔄 **Slack Provider** - Planned (contributions welcome)
- 📝 **Microsoft Teams Provider** - Planned (contributions welcome)

**Key Capability**: All providers can run simultaneously with a unified interface, allowing your AI assistant to seamlessly work across multiple chat platforms at once. [Learn more](#step-4-running-multiple-chat-providers-simultaneously) about this powerful feature.

### 🧭 The Story Behind This Project

> *We even see open-source MCP servers for Google Chat — but not sure about Microsoft Teams or Slack, officially or in open source. However, even the ones that do exist fall short in real-world applicability. They offer limited functionalities that cannot handle full-context workflows like this project demonstrates.*

This **multi-provider MCP framework** was born from a real frustration experienced by development teams trying to leverage AI assistants in their daily workflows.

---

#### **The Original Problem**

Picture this scenario: You're debugging a complex issue, your AI assistant suggests a solution, but you need to check if your teammates have encountered something similar. You switch to Google Chat, scroll through hundreds of messages, copy-paste error logs, wait for responses, then manually relay the solution back to your AI assistant.

This constant context-switching was breaking the flow of productive AI-assisted development.

---

#### **The Breaking Point**

During a critical production incident, a developer spent 30 minutes manually shuttling information between Claude (via Cursor) and the team's Google Chat space. The AI had the technical knowledge to help. The team had the contextual experience.
But there was no bridge connecting these two knowledge sources.

That's when we realized:

> **AI assistants need to be participants in team collaboration — not isolated tools.**

**Our Solution:**
- **Seamless Integration**: AI assistants become active participants in team chat
- **Contextual Awareness**: AI can search team history for similar issues and solutions
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: AI can share problems with the team and implement their suggestions
- **Knowledge Bridging**: Connect AI technical knowledge with team experiential knowledge

## 🎯 Built for Developer Extensibility

### 🏗️ Modular Provider Architecture

Each chat platform is implemented as an independent module:

```
src/providers/
├── google_chat/     # ✅ Complete implementation
├── slack/           # 📋 Framework ready for implementation  
└── teams/           # 📋 Framework ready for implementation
```


### 👥 Who's This For?

This project is designed for **two primary audiences**:

#### 🛠️ 1. Developers inside organizations

If you're a developer working in a team that uses **Google Chat**, and you're looking to integrate your **AI IDEs (like Cursor, CodeWhisperer, or Copilot Chat)** with team conversations — this MCP client will save you hours.
No more manually copying logs, checking for context, or waiting for someone to see your question.
Your AI agent can now directly:

* Search your chat history for relevant past discussions
* Share code snippets or error logs automatically
* Receive responses and convert them into actionable fixes
* Summarize ongoing team activities
* Fetch missing config/scripts from shared spaces

#### 💡 2. Open source contributors & AI platform builders

If you're building AI-powered tools, IDE integrations, or internal assistants — this is your starting point for a **multi-provider MCP architecture**.
You can fork this project to:

* Extend support for **Slack**, **Microsoft Teams**, or **custom messaging platforms**
* Build your own custom AI workflows on top of MCP

## Running Multiple Chat Providers Simultaneously

One of the key advantages of Multi Chat MCP Server is the ability to run **multiple chat providers simultaneously**. Each provider runs in its own server instance, allowing your AI assistant to interact with multiple platforms at once.

For example, you can configure both Google Chat and Slack MCP servers to run simultaneously:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google_chat": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory", "/path/to/multi-chat-mcp-server",
        "run", "-m", "src.server",
        "--provider", "google_chat"
      ]
    },
    "slack": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory", "/path/to/multi-chat-mcp-server",
        "run", "-m", "src.server",
        "--provider", "slack"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

With this setup, your AI assistant can:
- Access tools from all configured providers simultaneously
- Execute cross-platform actions with a single command
- Perform platform-specific operations through named providers

#### Real-World Multi-Platform Scenarios

| Scenario | Example Command to AI | What Happens |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Incident Response** | "Share this error log with both our Slack #on-call channel and Google Chat #tech-huddle team" | AI posts the error in both platforms simultaneously, with appropriate formatting for each |
| **Knowledge Consolidation** | "Find all discussions about the authentication issue across Slack #LLMSpace and Google Chat #LLMTools in the last week" | AI searches both platforms and presents a unified summary of all relevant conversations |
| **Cross-Team Coordination** | "Let the frontend team on Slack and backend team on Google Chat know we're delaying the release by 2 days" | AI composes appropriate messages for each team on their preferred platform |
| **Multi-Team Standups** | "Collect status updates from all teams across Slack and Google Chat from standup space and summarize them for last 3 days." | AI retrieves and consolidates information from both platforms into a single summary |

#### Business Value of Multi-Provider Integration

- **Reduce Tool Switching**: No need for developers to constantly switch between chat platforms for smaller use-cases like sharing error logs or instructions or reply
- **Unified Context**: Your AI assistant maintains awareness across all your organization's communication channels

Each provider is defined separately in `provider-config.yaml`, allowing you to extend support for any chat platform while maintaining a unified interface for your AI assistant.
